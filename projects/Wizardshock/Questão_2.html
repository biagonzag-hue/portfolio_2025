            <h3>LEOPOLD THE OLD</h3>
            <button class="collect">COLLECT</button>
            <p>A beacon of light and wisdom to the younger wizard generation in a time of such instability.
                Unfortunately he cannot cook. (Does not even know how to make himself a sandwich).</p>

            <h3>DARK LORD MERCILESS</h3>
            <button class="collect">COLLECT</button>
            <p>Wants to be recognized as the undisputed lord and master of dark magic, but there is no such thing as
                dark magic. Only magic. His favorite color is peach, he has a rare phobia of pasta, and his mom still
                refers to him by his real name: "Ian".</p>

            <h3>NORRIS PICKLE</h3>
            <button class="collect">COLLECT</button>
            <p>Bad at magic. Loves pickles, hates to be tickled. Sometimes thinks a pickle is a wand. He always wants
                his pet owl to protect him from scary monsters, wolves, and bears.</p>

            <h3>LEOPOLD THE GOLD</h3>
            <button class="collect">COLLECT</button>
            <p>The ill-fated twin brother of Leopold the Old. After watching an alchemy course on Wizard Tube, Leopold
                the Gold saved the kingdom of Wolfsbane from ruin by transforming all the coal into solid gold. However,
                with all this gold now in circulation the market value has plummeted and the people of Wolfsbane had to
                resort to burning their celebrated library for fuel.</p>

            <h3>RANDALL MAWR</h3>
            <button class="collect">COLLECT</button>
            <p>The only son of King Iwan. Randall forfeited his right to succeed his father as leader of the northern
                tribes choosing a life of adventure instead. A favorable outcome for his tribe as they believe him a
                simpleton. He travelled to Wizardshock to help raise the siege of the castle but became lost in the
                mountain porridge of Avena.</p>
