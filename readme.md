# 🌐 Bianca Gonzaga — Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, developed to showcase my projects, skills, and professional journey as an aspiring software developer with a background in Veterinary Medicine and Environmental Sciences.

The portfolio reflects my transition into technology, combining **analytical thinking from scientific research** with **front-end development practices**, focusing on clean architecture, responsiveness, and usability.

## ✨ About the Project

This portfolio was built from scratch using **semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, without external frameworks.  
Beyond visual presentation, the project serves as a learning environment where I experiment with layout systems, animations, and custom tooling.

One of the key highlights is a **custom-built visual inspection tool**, inspired by browser DevTools, created to deeply understand spacing, layout behavior, and the CSS box model.

- **HTML5** — semantic and accessible structure  
- **CSS3** — Flexbox, Grid, responsive design, animations  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — DOM manipulation, Intersection Observer, custom DevTools logic
